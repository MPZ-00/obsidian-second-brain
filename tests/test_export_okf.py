"""export_okf must translate faithfully or say it failed - never guess quietly.

Pins the six root causes behind the stress test's 12 export findings (fix 5/24):
pyyaml missing from the project env, capital Templates/ leaking, malformed YAML
silently mislabeled with the folder name (and prose dropped), dotted titles
losing their links (#93 regression), asset links degrading to plain text, and
the vault's own index.md being exported then clobbered by the bundle index.
