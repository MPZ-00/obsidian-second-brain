"""A slash command named in the docs has to exist as a file in `commands/` (#304).

`SKILL.md` told readers to run `/obsidian-setup`, which no adapter builds and
`install.sh` never installs, because `commands/obsidian-setup.md` was never written.
The README's comparison table named seven more by a short form (`/emerge`, `/world`,
`/ingest`) that nothing answers either. A reader who types one of those gets silence
and cannot tell a broken install from a wrong line, and a third-party survey of this
repo repeated `/obsidian-setup` as an install step, so the wrong name travels.

Only backticked names are checked. `/path/to/vault`, `</summary>` and a bare `/dist`
are not commands, and quoting is the one signal in the source that separates a command
from a path or an HTML tag.
