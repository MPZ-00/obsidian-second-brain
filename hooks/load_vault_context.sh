# hooks.json used to run `python3 load_vault_context.py` directly. On Windows
# that name belongs to the Microsoft Store App Execution Alias, which prints
# nothing and exits non-zero, so the hook injected no skill root and no vault
# manual and left one line in the session transcript to say so (#269). This
# wrapper finds an interpreter that runs, and when there is none it says so on
# stderr instead of failing mutely.
#
# stdin (the SessionStart payload) passes straight through to the Python half.

# and py.exe and never python3.exe, so `python3` resolves to the Microsoft Store
# App Execution Alias. That stub exists, prints nothing and exits non-zero, so an
# existence test passes and the caller silently does nothing (#269). Every
# candidate is therefore executed, not looked up. Uses bash 3.2 features only.
